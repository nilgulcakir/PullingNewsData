# PullingNewsData

A new application was made with data downloaded from the internet. What is important here is that it can be done by downloading from any website or API rather than the design. Most importantly, it is written using MVVM. TableViews are sized according to the length of the data. I have stated below the URL I used, based on the training I received.
